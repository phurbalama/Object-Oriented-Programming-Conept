1. Abstract : Abstract class cannot be instantiated and it usually contains at least one abstract method. It can have other method other than abstract. Also the abstract method cannot have any implementation.

2. Interface : Interface can contain only abstract methods and it also cannot be instantiated. In order to implement Interface, the keyword( implements ) need to be used. Interface is used to achieve total abstraction.
